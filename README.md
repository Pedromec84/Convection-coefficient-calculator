# Convection-coefficient-calculator

In this simple code, it is possible to calculate the convection coefficient for internal and external flows, over flat plate or over cross flow in cylinders.
The code prompts the user for data on fluid properties as well as some flow characteristics that are needed to calculate dimensionless numbers (Re, Pr, Nu, Gr, Ra).

Finally, the main simulation results are printed.
